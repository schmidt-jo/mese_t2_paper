## Content

This page contains supplementary visualizations and interactive content to support our 2025 publication. The
visualizations provide additional insight and detailed views on the data that complement the main findings.

## Visualizations
The links provide fly-through animations of the estimated R2 maps.
Those maps were estimated from Multi-Echo Spin-Echo (MESE) data acquired for 6 participants.

Each of the plots is interactive, control is provided to skim through the acquisition slices, zoom or reorient the plot.
In particular cortical and sub-cortical structures are clearly delineated.
The image points correspond to a cubic volume of 0.7 mm x 0.7 mm x 0.7 mm sidelength.
