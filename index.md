## Content

This page contains supplementary visualizations and interactive content to support our 2025 publication. The
visualizations provide additional insight and detailed views on the data that complement the main findings.

The Button Link at the top links to the repository containing code used in the publication.

## Visualizations
The links provide fly-through animations of the estimated R2 maps.
Those maps were estimated from Multi-Echo Spin-Echo (MESE) data acquired for 6 participants which are linked separately.

Each of the plots is interactive, control is provided to skim through, zoom or reorient the plot.
In particular cortical and sub-cortical structures are clearly delineated.

The image points correspond to a cubic volume of 0.7 mm x 0.7 mm x 0.7 mm sidelength.
These are separated by a gap of around 2 mm not acquired.

The animation shows the individual slices.
